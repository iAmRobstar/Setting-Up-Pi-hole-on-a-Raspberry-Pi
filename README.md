# PROJECTNAME

## Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance network security and privacy by implementing Pi-hole as a network-wide ad blocker on a Raspberry Pi. It aims to block intrusive advertisements and trackers across all connected devices, improving user experience and protecting privacy. Additionally, Pi-hole will be used to block known malicious domains, adding an extra layer of security against malware and phishing attacks. By eliminating unwanted ad content, the project seeks to reduce bandwidth usage and improve web page loading times, leading to more efficient network performance. The project will provide a centralized interface for managing and monitoring DNS requests, simplifying network administration and customization. It will also demonstrate the practical application of DNS-based ad-blocking technology, offering a hands-on learning experience in network security. Ultimately, the project will highlight the importance of customizable DNS-based ad-blocking in modern cybersecurity practices.
